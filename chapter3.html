<h1>CHAPTER 3</h1>

<p>Timmy waited for his mum to come home, he couldn’t wait to show her the new kitten he found earlier this morning. He picked fluffy up and walked into the living room, holding he kitten tightly so that he wouldn’t escape his embrace. ‘Mum, I have something to show you’ He said quietly before holding the kitten out to show her. ‘Can we please keep him?’ He asked while his mum looked at the kitten, clearly not expecting anything like this. ‘Well… we should try finding his owner first’ She sighed which made Timmy frown. He didn’t even think about that. ‘But what if we don’t find the owner?’ He asked hopefully. ‘I suppose we can keep him if no one owns him. But you need to promise me that you will look after him, pets are forever, not just until you get bored of them’ She added seriously. ‘I promise I will look after him mum! He can even sleep in my bed’ Timmy replied, setting the kitttten down on the floor carefully. ‘Well in that case I suppose he can stay with us’ She smiled, watching the kitten run around the kitchin. ‘Now, please go wash your hands, dinner will be ready soon’ She added.
