<h1>CHAPTER 2</h1>

<p>Johnny watched as Fluffy began to play with a string, he couldn’t help but laugh at the clumsiness of the tiny kitten. ‘Are you hungry, Fluffy?’ He asked, rummaging the cupboards for a dish small enough for Fluffy. ‘All I can give you now is milk’ Johnny added, opening the fridge and taking out the big milk jug. He carefully poured it into the dish and placed it in front of Fluffy, watching him drink the milk at the speed of light. You need to slow down Fluffy!’ Johnny laughed, petting Fluffy once he was done drinking his milk.</p>

<p> He then picked the kitten up and brought him out to his room, placing it down on his bed. Johnny was hoping that his parents would let him keep Fluffy, surely they would have to; a kitten so small had to have someone taking care of him and there was no way Johnny would give him away to a shelter! He watched as Fluffy curled up on his pillow, clearly tired after drinking all that milk. Johnny lay down next to his kitten, petting it gently as he watched it sleep. ‘Don’t worry Fluffy, my mum will love you, I’m sure she will let you stay with us’  </p>
